# Open Arduino RC Car
Hello, Welcome to the project page for Open Arduino RC Car project I have been working on for the past few months. I wanted to make a remote-contolled car using the Arduino microcontoller platorm, but I could not find any suitable tutorials that included beginner-frienly coding concepts or utilizing budget-friendly parts that are easy to scource. Considering these obstacles, I decided to create the entire RC car from scratch, and here it is. Below is an extensive documentation of the circutry and Arduino sketches.
